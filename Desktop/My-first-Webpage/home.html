<p style="color:rgb(126, 128, 0)">So there are two things that I really enjoy doing in my life which is cars and soccer.<br/>Firstly I like cars beccause they fascinate and inspire me but my number 1 brand in terms of cars is the VW and the car model that i admire a lot is the VW Vr6.


<p>And my second chose of things that I'm passionate about is soccer.<br/>I enjoy playing soccer and i also enjoy watching it also.<br/> So in the English Premiere League, I'm a Mancheser City fan and in the Spanish League i follow the under-dogs, the only Real team in the league,Real Madrid
